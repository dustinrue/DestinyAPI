1) **Sweaty K/D** is K/D on matches where the enemy team wins at least 3 rounds.

2) **Percent contribution** is a metric for determining how much you helped or hindered your team.

- +100 for kills
- -100 for deaths
- +33 for assists
- +25 for rezzes
- +12 for being rezzed

Scores are tabulated across all games for individuals and the team. And then a player's contribution is shown as percent of the team's total score.

3) **Last Guardian Actions** are:

- *'Never Say Die'* = Kill an enemy as the last guardian standing.
- *'From the Brink'* = Revive a teammate as the last guardian standing.
